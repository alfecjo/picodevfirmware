## Overview

The goal of this program is to read the joystick values from the BitDogLab joystick and display these values either on the terminal or on an OLED display. The joystick values are converted into digital values using an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), which allows us to read the position of the joystick.

## 🛠️ Logic Explanation

## Enhanced Project003 – Raspberry Pi Pico W or [BitDogLab](https://github.com/BitDogLab)

## Step-by-Step Logic

### 1. **Reading Joystick Values**

The program begins by setting up the necessary hardware, such as I2C and ADC, to communicate with the joystick and display. The joystick has two axes: X and Y. The X-axis controls horizontal movement and the Y-axis controls vertical movement.

- **X-axis** (GPIO26) and **Y-axis** (GPIO27) are connected to the ADC pins. The values read from these axes are in a digital range that corresponds to the joystick’s movement.

- The ADC reads these values, which will range between 0 and 4095, representing the joystick’s full range of motion.

### 2. **Mapping Joystick Movement to Directions**

After reading the raw values of the joystick (X and Y), the program maps these values to specific directions, which will be displayed on the OLED:

- **Horizontal Movement** (X-axis):
  - If `X < 500`, the joystick is moved to the **left**.
  - If `X > 3500`, the joystick is moved to the **right**.
  - Otherwise, the joystick is in a **central** position.

- **Vertical Movement** (Y-axis):
  - If `Y < 500`, the joystick is moved **down**.
  - If `Y > 3500`, the joystick is moved **up**.
  - Otherwise, the joystick is in a **central** position.

### 3. **Displaying Values**

The program updates the OLED display to show both the **raw X and Y values** and the **direction of movement**. The output on the display is updated every 500 milliseconds, showing the current joystick position.

- **Terminal Output:**
  - The program prints the joystick’s raw X and Y values in the terminal for debugging purposes. 
  - Additionally, the direction of movement is shown on the OLED display.

### 4. **OLED Display**

The OLED display shows two lines of information:
1. **Line 1**: Displays the raw values of `X` and `Y`.
2. **Line 2**: Displays the direction of the joystick movement, such as "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right", or "Center".

This real-time feedback allows users to visually track the joystick’s movement and direction.

## Summary

In summary, this program allows you to:
- Read the joystick’s digital values for both X and Y axes.
- Map these values to directional movement (Up, Down, Left, Right, or Center).
- Display the raw values and movement direction both on the terminal and on an OLED screen.
- Continuously update the display every 500 milliseconds for real-time tracking.

This simple yet effective logic makes it easy to monitor joystick movements for various applications, such as controlling robots or navigating menus in embedded systems.
